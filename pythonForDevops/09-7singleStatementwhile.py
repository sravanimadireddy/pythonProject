'''
Single statement while block
Just like the if block, if the while block consists of a single statement we can declare the entire loop in a single line. If there are multiple statements in the block that makes up the loop body, they can be separated by semicolons (;).

# Python program to illustrate 
# Single statement while block 
count = 0
while (count < 5): 
	count += 1
	print("Hello Geek")
